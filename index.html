                        Gore Magala possess wings with black, shroud-like membrane. They lack visual receptors, heightening their senses by
                         scattering scales from their wings to ascertain the locations of lifeforms. At the peak of their senses, feelers
                          extend from their head, their wings unfurl, and they become frenzied. They're feared not only for their sinister
                           appearance but also for the mysterious Frenzy virus they carry.
